                <h2>Herman, My Cat</h2>
                <img src="images/pets/herman.jpg" alt="herman">
                <p>Herman is 10 years old (turning 11 on 4/20/2023). He has no teeth and is defninitely evil. He bites (or gums) and scratches us often. I love him anyway. He's my baby.</p>

                <h2>Bobby, My Partner's Dog</h2>
                <img src="images/pets/bobby.jpg" alt="bobby">
                <p>Bobby is 5 years old (turning 6 in September 2023). He is a good boy, but also a little baby at the same time. He is very anxious, but we're trying to help him with that. &hearts;</p>

                <h2>Kitkat, My Mother's Cat</h2>
                <img src="images/pets/kitkat.jpg" alt="kitkat">
                <p>KitKat is 11 years old (turning 12 on 6/24/2023). She is very small and very sweet (most of the time). She has a short temper and needs to be treated with respect and dignity.</p>

                <h2>Coco, My Step-Mother's Cat</h2>
                <img src="images/pets/coco.jpg" alt="coco">
                <p>Coco is a strange cat. She is very vocal and likes and hates to be pet at the same time. She's very skittish (she was declawed as a kitten (cruel)). Nothing we can do about that now. IF YOU DON'T WANT NICE FURNITURE SCRATCHED, DON'T GET A CAT!</p>

                <h2>Zoey, My Step-Mother's Cat</h2>
                <img src="images/pets/zoey.jpg" alt="zoey">
                <p>Zoey is very sweet. She loves attention, but is also fairly skittish. She loves laying on heat vents and being pet and scratched. She has cancer on her arm and if it doesn't go away with treatment, they might have to amputate her arm :(.</p>

                <h2>Rocky, My Step-Mother's Cat</h2>
                <img src="images/pets/rocky.jpg" alt="rocky">
                <img id="grave" src="images/pets/grave.gif" alt="grave">
                <p>Rocky has passed away, unfortunately. The cats were very overfed (AND I TOLD THEM THAT) and he had a kitty aneurism basically... He died in my brothers arms.. He was very sweet and loved affection and loved to be pet. Zoey misses him a lot, and so do I...</p>

                <h2>Milo, My Father and Step-Mother's Dog</h2>
                <img src="images/pets/milo.jpg" alt="milo">
                <p>Milo is a golden-doodle and he is a very good boy. He is very obedient and very well behaved. He knows a bunch of tricks and never tries to run away or jumps on people or anything like that.</p>

                <h2>Wesley, My Father and Step-Mother's Dog</h2>
                <img src="images/pets/Wesley.jpg" alt="wesley">
                <p>Wesley is a doodle/Austrailian shepard mix. Why they got a dog that wasn't hypoallergenic like Milo, I'm not sure. He has so much energy (because of the shepard) and is poorly behaved. He can't be left home alone without destroying the house. He is very playful (loves to bother Milo) and loves to fetch.</p>
